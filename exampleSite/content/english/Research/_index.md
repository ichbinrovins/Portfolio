      ### Synthesis and Characterization of 2D Transition Metal Dichalcogenides (TMDCs)
      This project focuses on the large-area growth of 2D TMDCs using advanced fabrication techniques like Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD), Low-Pressure CVD (LPCVD), and Sputtering. The synthesized materials are characterized using tools such as Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Raman Spectroscopy, and Gas Sensing setups. This work aims to develop quantum materials for sensing applications and study their optoelectronic properties.

      ### Image Classification by Quantum Convolutional Neural Network
      This project explores the application of quantum computing in image classification. By implementing Quantum Convolutional Neural Networks (QCNNs) on platforms like Google Colab using libraries such as PennyLane and Qiskit, this work demonstrates the potential of quantum machine learning for efficient data processing and classification tasks.

      ### Effect of Amplitude Damping and Generalized Amplitude Damping Channels on Bell States
      In this project, the impact of noise channels like amplitude damping and generalized amplitude damping on Bell states is analyzed. Using Mathematica, the work investigates how these channels affect the coherence and entanglement properties of quantum states, providing insights into quantum information processing under realistic conditions.
