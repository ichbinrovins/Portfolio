Hello and welcome to my portfolio! I'm Rovins, a researcher fascinated by quantum materials, semiconductor devices, and batteries. With a Master's in Quantum Technology from IIT Jodhpur and a background in Physics, I'm on a journey driven by curiosity and innovation.

My research focuses on how quantum materials can improve semiconductor devices and batteries. I explore how special properties of these materials, like superconductivity and topological insulators, can be used in new electronic and photonic devices.

I also study semiconductor devices to make them more efficient and reliable. My aim is to help advance computing, communication, and sensing technologies with these new devices.

Additionally, I work on developing better batteries for storing energy sustainably. By working with different experts, I hope to contribute to a greener future.

In this portfolio, you'll find my research projects, publications, and insights. Whether you're a fellow researcher, a potential collaborator, or simply curious about my work, I'm excited to share and discuss with you.

Thank you for joining me on this academic journey, and I'm looking forward to connecting with you."
